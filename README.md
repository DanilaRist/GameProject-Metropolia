# GameProject-Metropolia
Procedural programming project
Game is based around trivia questions, to make it more engaging we added monsters that are stored in the database. Monster database contains: name, question, possible and correct answers and attack value. 
The player has his name and healt value stored. The player rolls the dice and faces the corresponding monster. If he answers the monster's question correctly, he pasess without loosing life and gets 1p, if not - monster attacks. upon gaining 5p, we go to lvl2, where we have to face harder monsters with the same logic. getting 12 points allows us to face the big bad guy with only one question. If answered incorrectly the player is "dead" otherwise he wins the game.
